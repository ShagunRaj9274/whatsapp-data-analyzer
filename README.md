# whatsapp-chat-analysis

The WhatsApp Chat Analyzer is an interactive data analysis project built with Python and Streamlit, designed to transform raw WhatsApp chats into meaningful insights and engaging visualizations.
By simply uploading an exported chat file, users can explore communication patterns, discover the most active participants, identify peak activity hours, and visualize conversations through word clouds, emoji trends, and heatmaps.
